<h2>Frontend Developer</h2>
I am a self-driven and detail-oriented Frontend developer with 2 years of experience in the industry seeking a position at collaborative team environment. I believe that my technical skills and knowledge will render me a valuable addition to your web development team. I’m passionate about developing responsive, interactive, accessible websites and web features to drive up online traffic and sales, bringing the company to greater heights. 

<h3>Experience</h3>
My portfolio includes 40+ modern and responsive Pet Projects. From landing pages to full-fledged websites and the list continues to grow. Experience has taught me to take website accessibility, responsiveness and performance seriously, especially on mobile devices. In every project all elements of the user interaction with the site are animated and create a pleasant feeling of “high cost” when viewing the site, which also positively affects the attitude of potential customers to the company.

I try to bring something special to every project, whether it's a new learned technology or a beautiful animation of elements.

Right now, I'm going to be learning Node.js and Next.js, which I intend to use in my spare time to develop a website for my Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.
