<h2>FRONTEND DEVELOPER</h2>
I am a self-driven and detail-oriented Front-end Developer with 2 years of experience. I believe that my technical skills and knowledge will make me a valuable addition to your web development team. I am passionate about developing responsive, interactive, accessible websites and web features to increase online traffic and sales and take the company to the next level.

<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
My portfolio includes <strong>40+</strong> modern and responsive Pet Projects. From landing pages to full-fledged websites and the list continues to grow.
<br>
I try to bring something special to each project, whether it is a new studied technology or a beautiful animation of elements, which will create a pleasant feeling of “expensiveness” when viewing the site, which also positively affects the attitude of potential customers towards the company.
<br>
Experience has taught me to take website accessibility, responsiveness and performance seriously, especially on mobile devices.
Right now, I'm focused on learning Node.js and Next.js, which I intend to use in my spare time to develop a website for my Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.
