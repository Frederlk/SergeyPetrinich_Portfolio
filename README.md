I believe that my technical skills and knowledge will make me a valuable addition to your web development team. I am passionate about developing responsive, interactive, accessible websites and web features to increase online traffic and sales and take the company to the next level.

### EXPERIENCE

My portfolio includes **40+** modern and responsive Pet Projects. From landing pages to full-fledged websites and the list continues to grow.

I try to bring something special to each project, whether it is a new studied technology or a beautiful animation of elements, which will create a pleasant feeling of “expensiveness” when viewing the site, which also positively affects the attitude of potential customers towards the company.

Experience has taught me to take website accessibility, responsiveness and performance seriously, especially on mobile devices.
